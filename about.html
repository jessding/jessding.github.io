<h2>hi there!</h2>
I'm Jessica Ding (Jess Ding for short or jessding, my kerberos) from Austin, Texas! I'm a freshman at MIT (class 
of 2023) planning to major in Computer Science and Electrical Engineering (course 6-2) and Mathematics (course 18), with a 
possible concentration in linguistics (course 24). I like making things, learning things, and performing (at) things, so in 
my free time you'll see me dancing, sewing, DIYing, reading, and learning!<br><br>

For high school, I attended the Liberal Arts and Science Academy in Austin, Texas. Here, I led Engineering Club and 
Mu Alpha Theta (Math Honor Society), co-led Choreopop Dance Team, and was active in Math Club, (Women in) Computer 
Science Club, CyberPatriot, Science Olympiad, and the French program. I also was heavily involved in competition math, played 
cello in the orchestra, volunteered for Health Through Science, and tutored for the math and computer science peer tutoring 
programs. A couple of my favorite and most unique classes at LASA were Digital Electronics and Computational Problem Solving. 
You can find out about these and other classes on my projects & past work page.<br><br>

In the summers of 2015, 2016, and 2017 I attended Honors Summer Math Camp, and in 2019 I was a counselor for HSMC. 
I did research through HSMC in 2016 and 2017, and published in BioData Mining, a peer-reviewed open access journal, as well 
as arXiv. I also won the 2017 Siemens Competition Regional Semifinalist award with my team and mentor. You can also find out
