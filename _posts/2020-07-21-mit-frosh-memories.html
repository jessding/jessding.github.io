<p>In August 2019, I (like most other college freshmen) came onto campus not knowing what to expect. I had gotten some small bites of independent living through several summers of math camp<sup><a href="#1" id="ref1">[1]</a></sup>, but I was mostly void of preconceived notions of MIT culture. However, when I left campus ~7 months later in March 2020 (RIP corona-times), I brought back new friendships, new experiences, and new cultural networks. Below is a list (in somewhat chronological order) of my favorite memories of those 7 months, which althogether comprise my MIT freshman experience<sup><a href="#1" id="ref1">[2]</a></sup>. Enjoy!</p>

    <p><b>DEAL scavenger hunt</b> DEAL (Discover Entrepreneurship and Leadership) is one of the 14 or so FPOPs (First-year Pre-Orientation Programs) offered to incoming freshmen. By nature of an FPOP, the people in DEAL were some of the first people I met on campus, which was nice because then I had ~30 more faces to recognize and say hi to on campus. At the end of the week-long program there's a scavenger hunt for DEAL/MIT-related things around Boston, and it's an awesome way to get used to the city and see some cool landmarks along the way!</p>

<sup id="1"><a href="#ref1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text.">[1]</a> There's a lot of math camps in the world, but when I say "math camp" I almost always mean Honors Summer Math Camp at Texas State University. Math camp is on my list of things I want to write about, so hopefully soon I'll have a post explaining it here.</sup> <br/>

<sup id="1"><a href="#ref1" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text.">[2]</a> Standard disclaimer: everyone's freshman year experience is different and valid! Just because I lived mine like this doesn't necessarily mean you should too. Also, if you want more ideas of MIT culture, the <a href="https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/">MIT admissions blogs</a> were made just for that!</sup>
