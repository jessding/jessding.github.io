blurb: "oh, how quickly and abruptly frosh year ended"
---
<p>In August 2019, I (like most other college freshmen) came onto campus not knowing what to expect. I had gotten some small bites of independent living through several summers of math camp<sup><a href="#1" id="ref1">[1]</a></sup>, but I was mostly void of preconceived notions of MIT culture. However, when I left campus ~7 months later in March 2020 (RIP corona-times), I brought back new friendships, new experiences, and new cultural networks. Below is a list (in somewhat chronological order) of my favorite memories of those 7 months, which althogether comprise my MIT freshman experience<sup><a href="#2" id="ref2">[2]</a></sup>. Enjoy!</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><b>DEAL scavenger hunt</b> DEAL (Discover Entrepreneurship and Leadership) is one of the 14 or so FPOPs (First-year Pre-Orientation Programs) offered to incoming freshmen. By nature of an FPOP, the people in DEAL were some of the first people I met on campus, which was nice because then I had ~30 more faces to recognize and say hi to on campus. At the end of the week-long program there's a scavenger hunt for DEAL/MIT-related things around Boston, and it's an awesome way to get used to the city and see some cool landmarks along the way!</p>

    <p><b>REX/rush week</b> REX (Residential Exploration) and rush are two different things<sup><a href="#3" id="ref3">[3]</a></sup>, but they both happen in the same first couple weeks of the fall semester<sup><a href="#4" id="ref4">[4]</a></sup>. REX was fun because it's almost like a second CPW — I got to make several cool things, and it was probably the second time (after CPW) I was introduced to the awesome restaurants in Boston (Tosci's, Pepper Sky, Abide, Flour, Tatte...).</p> <br/>

    <p>Even though I wasn't planning to join a frat (yes, there are co-ed frats too), rush was one of the first times I realized how lucky I was to go to school in/near Boston, a big city that has easy water access (Charles River → Massachusetts Bay → Atlantic Ocean !!) and a bajillion other colleges/universities around. Also, I digress, but the northeast is just generally smaller and easier to get around (compare that to living in the middle of big ol' Texas), which relates to another bullet point further down.</p><br>

    <p>But anyway, the frats go really hard for <a href="https://mitrush2019.sched.com/">rush events</a>. There were several steak and lobster dinners, harbor cruises, a paintball event, bubble soccer, beach trips, go kart racing, and lots and lots of food. Many of these events were open to any student<sup><a href="#5" id="ref5">[5]</a></sup>, but I didn't really take full advantage of rush, oops. I did go to one steak and lobster dinner and one boat cruise though. The dinner was incredible, and the night of the cruise was stormy and generally a rainy mess but the event was lively and fun — the floor of the upper decks was bouncing from the music and partying below (though I'm not really sure if that's more of an indicator of the liveliness of the event or the structural integrity of that boat). I also went with one of my roommates (Diane) and several of her friends, a few of which I would end up becoming close friends with as well through the cruise!</p>

    <p><b>Boston Night Market</b> Remember when I said that the whole MIT-is-in/near-Boston-thing is awesome because Boston is a big city with a lot of things happening? Well, here's another thing that happens: Boston Night Market is an Asian night market with booths from many restaurants around town, and many college students and other young people attend. It's also been an event that I've wanted to go to since I learned of its existence like 2 years ago, so of course I entered their Instagram giveaway for $100 of food vouchers prior to their Fall Night Market in September. I didn't think I would win or anything (what were the odds?), so I didn't really make any concrete plans to attend, and forgot about it after entering. But then lo and behold, I actually won that giveaway (again, what were the odds?). So I ended up frantically texting people a few days before and asking if they happened to have any extra tickets to BNM. Luckily, my CPW host's roommate (Amber) and friends happened to have an extra ticket, so I went with them and we had a great time using up those vouchers. Even though the weather was colder than I'd anticipated and it was raining at the end of the night, I still enjoyed eating all that yummy food and becoming more comfortable with some 2022s.</p> <br>

<sup id="1"><a href="#ref1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text.">[1]</a> There's a lot of math camps in the world, but when I say "math camp" I almost always mean Honors Summer Math Camp at Texas State University. Math camp is on my list of things I want to write about, so hopefully soon I'll have a post explaining it here.</sup><br/>

<sup id="2"><a href="#ref2" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text.">[2]</a> Standard disclaimer: everyone's freshman year experience is different and valid! Just because I lived mine like this doesn't necessarily mean you should too. Also, if you want more ideas of MIT culture, the <a href="https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/">MIT admissions blogs</a> were made just for that!</sup><br/>

<sup id="3"><a href="#ref3" title="Jump back to footnote 3 in the text.">[3]</a> REX is a series of events overseen by the dorms/DormCon to introduce freshmen to each of the dorms' cultures, and rush is a series of events overseen by IFC (Interfraternity Council) to introduce the 27 fraternities and recruit unaffiliated students.</sup><br/>

<sup id="4"><a href="#ref4" title="Jump back to footnote 4 in the text.">[4]</a> So does sorority recruitment, but I'm kind of glossing over it for the purposes of this blog post since recruitment is a very different type of event from rush (and I didn't really fully attend recruitment anyway).</sup><br/>

<sup id="5"><a href="#ref5" title="Jump back to footnote 5 in the text.">[5]</a> Okay, I'm pretty sure there's some kind of ban if you're affiliated (with a frat or srat), and other rush events are invite-only, but in general rush isn't restricted to just to freshmen or just guys or anything.</sup><br/>
